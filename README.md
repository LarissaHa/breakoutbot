# BreakoutBot

This repository contains an example project of a text based adventure game built with Rasa. It's an open community
project and the goal is to host a proper text based escape room that you can play with. It is a community project 
and we're recording the milestones. You can watch the videos describing how this was built here. 

## Contributing 

This project is a community project and there are many ways you can contribute. 

- **Give feedback.** If you play with the assistant locally and you notice that there are features missing we'd love to hear it.
- **Add data.** If you think that there's data missing for some of our intents you're free to create a PR. 
- **Think along.** There are tricky parts to making a proper adventure game in Rasa and we're still learning as we go. 
  Feel free to join some of the discussions in the issues to think along. 
- **Report bugs.** If you feel like some of the commands make no sense, feel free to let us know! 

## Start Locally

If you want to play around with this game locally you can clone this repository and install Rasa.

```
git clone git@github.com:RasaHQ/breakoutbot.git
pip install rasa
``` 

Once you've done this, you should be able to play the game via the shell.

```python
rasa shell
```
